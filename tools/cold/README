This directory contains a port of the Lisp Machine cold load generator
to Common Lisp.

It probably requires a 64-bit Common Lisp implementation to run.

The .asd file isn't functional yet with ASDF, to use the code do:

(load "cold.asd")
(load "coldut")
(load "coldld")
(load "sysdcl")
(cold:make-cold "filename.lod")
